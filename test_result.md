# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Fix and complete the FRONTEND for a full-stack app with Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend and React + CRACO + Tailwind frontend.
  Backend API is fully working at http://localhost:8001/api with routes for auth (register, login, phone-login) and files (upload, list, delete).
  
  Requirements:
  1. Use REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable for all API calls
  2. Authentication UI: Email/password login, Email/password registration, Phone OTP using Firebase
  3. Auth Logic: Proper error messages, clear inputs on tab switch, auto-switch to login after registration
  4. File Upload UI: Upload, list, delete files with proper authentication
  5. Store JWT securely in localStorage

      GITHUB IMPORT FIXED - Fixed critical issues with imported GitHub project.
      
      Issues Fixed:
      1. Fixed React root element error - public/index.html was missing div#root
      2. Converted backend from Node.js to Python FastAPI (supervisor runs Python)
      3. Phone tab login is now visible and working
      4. Added greeting feature to Dashboard
      
      Backend (Python FastAPI) provides:
      - POST /api/auth/register - Email registration
      - POST /api/auth/login - Email login with JWT
      - POST /api/auth/phone-login - Phone OTP login
      - POST /api/files/upload - File upload with auth
      - GET /api/files - List user files
      - DELETE /api/files/:id - Delete file
      
      Current setup:
      - Backend: http://localhost:8001 (Python FastAPI) ✅
      - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (React) ✅
      
      Ready for backend testing to verify auth flows work correctly.

      MAJOR FRONTEND REDESIGN COMPLETED - Custom login page and dashboard overhaul
      
      **Phase 1: Custom Glassmorphic Login Page**
      - Implemented custom login/register design from provided ZIP file
      - Random background image selector (10 images: bg1-bg10.jpg)
      - Glassmorphic transparent card with backdrop-blur effect
      - Boxicons integration for icons
      - Enhanced error handling with intelligent frontend mapping:
        * "User not found. Please register first." (404 from backend)
        * "Invalid email or password" (401 from backend)
        * "User already registered. Please log in." (400 from backend)
      - Phone number option in register form (UI only, uses existing backend)
      - Auto-clear inputs and errors on view change
      - Auto-switch to login after successful registration
      
      **Phase 2: Backend Extensions (NEW Features)**
      Added endpoints for new features:
      - User Profile: GET/PUT /api/user/profile (displayName management)
      - Notes CRUD: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notes
      - Text Storage CRUD: POST/GET/DELETE /api/texts
      - All with JWT authentication
      
      **Phase 3: Dashboard Complete Redesign**
      Modern cloud storage UI with:
      - Responsive sidebar navigation (mobile hamburger menu)
      - Top navbar with time-based greeting (Asia/Calcutta timezone)
      - Display name from user profile (editable in Settings)
      - Sections implemented:
        1. Dashboard - Overview with stats cards and recent files
        2. Upload - File upload with progress bar
        3. My Files - View and delete uploaded files
        4. Notes - Create, view, delete notes (title + content)
        5. Text Storage - Save, view, copy, delete text snippets
        6. Settings - Edit display name, view user info, logout
      
      **Phase 4: UX Enhancements**
      - Clean, modern, professional UI (like real SaaS products)
      - Smooth transitions and animations
      - Mobile responsive design
      - Empty states with call-to-actions
      - Success/error notifications
      - Loading states for all async operations
      
      **Backend Status:**
      ✅ All existing auth endpoints working (no changes)
      ✅ New user profile endpoints added
      ✅ New notes endpoints added  
      ✅ New text storage endpoints added
      
      **Frontend Status:**
      ✅ Custom login page with random backgrounds
      ✅ Enhanced error messages
      ✅ Phone registration option (UI)
      ✅ Complete dashboard redesign
      ✅ Notes feature fully implemented
      ✅ Text storage feature fully implemented
      ✅ Settings page with name editor
      ✅ Compiled successfully (1 minor ESLint warning, no impact)
      
      **Ready for Testing:**
      - Backend endpoints need testing (notes, texts, user profile)
      - Frontend flows need UI testing
      - All auth flows should work as before
      - New features (notes, text storage) need verification
